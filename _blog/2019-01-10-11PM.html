    <h2>AI and a new game mode</h2>
  </header>

      Today I added a game mode that lets you pit one AI against another AI.
      It can be interesting to watch the AI to see how it acts against different monsters
      and monster compositions.

      My intention was for the game mode to be informative and a way to study AI behavior,
      maybe in preparation for a fight, but I found that it is quite fun to watch just watch them.

      While I added this game mode I also added a second level of AI behavior.
      Previously there was only one AI behavior, level 1, that finds the closest enemey
      and tries to attack it with the most appropriate ability. It does this on every tile it is on.
      If it can't attack it it moves towards it instead, one tile at the time and reevaluates.

      But the new AI, level 2, prioritizes ranged enemies. If it can't attack it moves, and if it can't move
      it tries to attack the nearest enemy. More specifically, if it can't attack the ranged enemy and have no
      moves left it will run AI level 1 instead.

      There are more AIs to add but that will be another day.
