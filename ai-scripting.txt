Actions are either Ability, Move, Defend, Wait.

When Ability, the first check is to see if the Ability
is usable

Secondly, find if there are any conditions that specify Ability targets (hitable).


When Ability, find out who (self, actor, ground) to target and
who to hit (self, allies, enemies, all), and how many to hit.

Who to target is only decided in the Act part of the script by declaring "target:[self|ally|enemy]".
Who to hit is decided in the Act part by declaring "on" before the target to hit
or in the Condition part by declaring "ability" before who to hit.

If the Condition does not declare "ability", then the Condition is fulfilled based on
the state of the board rather than the ability.

When Move find out where to move to.

When Defend just Defend.

When Wait just Wait.
