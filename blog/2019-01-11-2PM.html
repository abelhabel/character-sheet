      I added the monster sprite, name and description to the character sheet so
      that you know what you are looking at. I have not yet added a description for
      all the monsters so currently it will just say "No description available".

      I also took the time to update the ability compendium and the bestiary
      so that they also show the sprite for the monster/ability. It looks better
      and obviously makes it clearer what you are looking at.

      The bestiary and ability compendium are now linked to in the lobby.
