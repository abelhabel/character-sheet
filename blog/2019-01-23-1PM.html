      Since the beginning I have wanted to make elements have mechanical meaning. It is nice
      to different elements for flavors sake but if a game element exist it also has to be tied to
      to rules, ie mechanical.

      There are many ways you can make elements meaningful but I decided to add them with the idea of "luck as variety"
      which is often implemented as a critical hit system. So now, whenever a monster takes damage it has a 5% chance of
      receiving an ailment based on the element the monster was damaged by. There are two ailments per
      <a href='/rules#element'>element</a> and you can read all about them <a href='/rules#ailment'>here</a>.
    </p>

      I'm also experimenting with a detailed match setup where you get to choose arena, teams, game mode, cash etc. This will
      probably be in the final version but for now it is on the live realm but in an unfinished state, though usable.
