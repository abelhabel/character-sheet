It does this on every tile it is on.\n      If it can't attack it it moves towards it instead, one tile at the time and reevaluates.\n\n      But the new AI, level 2, prioritizes ranged enemies. If it can't attack it moves, and if it can't move\n      it tries to attack the nearest enemy. More specifically, if it can't attack the ranged enemy and have no\n      moves left it will run AI level 1 instead.\n\n      There are more AIs to add but that will be another day.\n    </p>\n  </section>\n  <footer>\n    <p>\n      Posted on\n      <time datetime=\"Fri, 11 Jan 2019 04:09:31 GMT\">Fri, 11 Jan 2019</time>\n      by Andreas Olsson.\n    </p>\n  </footer>\n</article>\n"}]}
