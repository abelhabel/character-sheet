It is nice\n      to different elements for flavors sake but if a game element exist it also has to be tied to\n      to rules, ie mechanical.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      There are many ways you can make elements meaningful but I decided to add them with the idea of \"luck as variety\"\n      which is often implemented as a critical hit system. So now, whenever a monster takes damage it has a 5% chance of\n      receiving an ailment based on the element the monster was damaged by. There are two ailments per\n      <a href='/rules#element'>element</a> and you can read all about them <a href='/rules#ailment'>here</a>.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      I'm also experimenting with a detail match setup where you get to choose arena, teams, game mode, cash etc. This will\n      probably be in the final version but for now it is on the live realm but in an unfinished state, thoush usable.\n    </p>\n  </section>\n  <footer>\n    <p>\n      Posted on\n      <time datetime=\"Wed, 23 Jan 2019 18:10:24 GMT\">Wed, 23 Jan 2019</time>\n      by Andreas Olsson.\n    </p>\n  </footer>\n</article>\n"},{"id":"2019-01-16-11PM","title":"Rules","time":"Thu, 17 Jan 2019 04:36:12 GMT","html":"<article id=\"2019-01-16-11PM\" class=\"blog-post\">\n  <header>\n    <a href=\"blog/Rules\"><h2>Rules</h2></a>\n  </header>\n  <section>\n    <p>\n      I added something fantastic today. Rules!\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      There is finally a central place to look up rules about the game. Even for myself, this\n      is a boon because I don't have to be in doubt about a rule in the future. I have tried to\n      be as clear as possible so that regarding skill level you can understand.

So,\n      today I have spent some time making some things clearer.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      I added a little widget next to the initiative order that tells you whose team's turn it is,\n      which monster's turn it is and what the current round is. There is also a button to show\n      smaller versions of the monster cards, if you think the cards take up too much space.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      I also added the cost to monster cards so you know before you are buying a monster how much it costs.\n      It is very strange that I didn't add that to begin with.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      You can also give the team you are creating a name. That name will then be used during the battle\n      to display whose team's turn it is.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Other interface changes include: Buttons are looks the same, Back to lobby button in team select,\n      buttons don't have unexpected behavior.\n    </p>\n  </section>\n  <footer>\n    <p>\n      Posted on\n      <time datetime=\"Tue, 15 Jan 2019 21:58:38 GMT\">Tue, 15 Jan 2019</time>\n      by Andreas Olsson.\n    </p>\n  </footer>\n</article>\n"},{"id":"2019-01-14-6PM","title":"New_feature,_Unit_placement","time":"Mon, 14 Jan 2019 23:21:19 GMT","html":"<article id=\"2019-01-14-6PM\" class=\"blog-post\">\n  <header>\n    <a href=\"blog/New_feature,_Unit_placement\"><h2>New feature, Unit placement</h2></a>\n  </header>\n  <section>\n    <p>\n      Something that I have been wanting to implement for a quite a while is unit placement.\n      Unit placement is very important aspect of tactics in a game like this. It lets you\n      decide where to place each unit on the battle field so that you for example can protect\n      your ranged units and/or place your aggressive units at the front.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      So, today I added this feature. Once you have selected your team you will see the battle\n      arena with your units already arranged in some fashion but it lets you select the units\n      individually and place them within two columns, depending if you start on the left or\n      right side. However, it does not let you see what your oppenent unit placement is.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      This feature required changes to many other systems which forced me to rethink some\n      of those systems and also refactor some code. It works for all game modes in all my tests\n      so now I'll just have to see what bugs show up when others test it.\n    </p>\n  </section>\n  <footer>\n    <p>\n      Posted on\n      <time datetime=\"Mon, 14 Jan 2019 23:21:19 GMT\">Mon, 14 Jan 2019</time>\n      by Andreas Olsson.\n    </p>\n  </footer>\n</article>\n"},{"id":"2019-01-13-2PM","title":"You're_captured,_stupid_bug!","time":"Sun, 13 Jan 2019 19:31:36 GMT","html":"<article id=\"2019-01-13-2PM\" class=\"blog-post\">\n  <header>\n    <a href=\"blog/You're_captured,_stupid_bug!\"><h2>You're captured, stupid bug!</h2></a>\n  </header>\n  <section>\n    <p>\n      I found, with help from the dane, some annoying bugs today but they were\n      hunted down and crushed.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The first bug was a silly rounding error when selecting a team. If you selected\n      a stack of units, ie holding down shift, it rounded up rather than down when determining\n      how many stacks you could afford of that unit. This allowed you to pick more units than you\n      could afford.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The second bug was more tricky to track down but the error was just as silly. When a monster,\n      is removed from the game, ie when it dies, I had forgotten to remove it from the waiting list.\n      There are three lists for keeping track of the initiaitve order: will act, has acted, waiting. So,\n      when a monster had waited and it would later be it's turn it would immediately be killed, which\n      in turn removes that monster from the battle grid. At that time, though, that position on the grid\n      might be occupied by another monster so you remove the wrong monster from the grid.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      A third bug had been introduced when I made the last AI changes. The AI didn't end it's turn properly,\n      so if there were more than one stack of the same monster the game wouldn't know which of these monster's turn it was.\n    </p>\n  </section>\n  <footer>\n    <p>\n      Posted on\n      <time datetime=\"Sun, 13 Jan 2019 19:31:36 GMT\">Sun, 13 Jan 2019</time>\n      by Andreas Olsson.\n    </p>\n  </footer>\n</article>\n"},{"id":"2019-01-11-2PM","title":"UI_changes_to_character_sheet","time":"Fri, 11 Jan 2019 19:12:47 GMT","html":"<article id=\"2019-01-11-2PM\" class=\"blog-post\">\n  <header>\n    <a href=\"blog/UI_changes_to_character_sheet\"><h2>UI changes to character sheet</h2></a>\n  </header>\n  <section>\n    <p>\n      I added the monster sprite, name and description to the character sheet so\n      that you know what you are looking at.

It does this on every tile it is on.\n      If it can't attack it it moves towards it instead, one tile at the time and reevaluates.\n\n      But the new AI, level 2, prioritizes ranged enemies. If it can't attack it moves, and if it can't move\n      it tries to attack the nearest enemy. More specifically, if it can't attack the ranged enemy and have no\n      moves left it will run AI level 1 instead.\n\n      There are more AIs to add but that will be another day.\n    </p>\n  </section>\n  <footer>\n    <p>\n      Posted on\n      <time datetime=\"Fri, 11 Jan 2019 04:09:31 GMT\">Fri, 11 Jan 2019</time>\n      by Andreas Olsson.\n    </p>\n  </footer>\n</article>\n"}]}
