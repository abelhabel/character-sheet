      A lot of feedback I have received has been about the interface being unclear. So,
      today I have spent some time making some things clearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      I added a little widget next to the initiative order that tells you whose team's turn it is,
      which monster's turn it is and what the current round is. There is also a button to show
      smaller versions of the monster cards, if you think the cards take up too much space.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also added the cost to monster cards so you know before you are buying a monster how much it costs.
      It is very strange that I didn't add that to begin with.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also give the team you are creating a name. That name will then be used during the battle
      to display whose team's turn it is.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other interface changes include: Buttons are looks the same, Back to lobby button in team select,
      buttons don't have unexpected behavior.
