      Something that I have been wanting to implement for a quite a while is unit placement.
      Unit placement is very important aspect of tactics in a game like this. It lets you
      decide where to place each unit on the battle field so that you for example can protect
      your ranged units and/or place your aggressive units at the front.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, today I added this feature. Once you have selected your team you will see the battle
      arena with your units already arranged in some fashion but it lets you select the units
      individually and place them within two columns, depending if you start on the left or
      right side. However, it does not let you see what your oppenent unit placement is.
    </p>

      This feature required changes to many other systems which forced me to rethink some
      of those systems and also refactor some code. It works for all game modes in all my tests
      so now I'll just have to see what bugs show up when others test it.
