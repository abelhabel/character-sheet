      I found a wonderful website that lists images that are in the public domain. They happend
      to have a section with <a href='https://freeclassicimages.com/Fantasy_Art.html'>fantasy art</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, I looked them through and decided upon a few images that I thought would be great to add
      some flavor to the otherwise very plain user interface. They worked out great so now all cards
      have a background that communicates what the faction is. I think it looks great and makes the game
      a little nicer to look at.
