      I have been thinking about and discussing the introduction to the game. Currently,
      the game expects you to accept that you will be defeated because you don't know the rules,
      or that you first read the rules, the monsters, and the abilities. All this information is indeed
      available from the first screen you see but that does not remove the fundamental problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fundamental problem, as I see it, is that the game has a complexity to the degree that
      it is not possible to immediately use the tools that are available. This is how it should be so
      the solution does not lie in reducing said complexity but rather create an entry point to the game
      that does not give you all the tools at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such an entry point can be done in many ways and the most obvious example is a tutorial. However, I am
      not interested in making a tutorial as part of the game, but I do want to make videos that show how to play the game.
      The problem with tutorials is that you are not playing the game in the proper sense, which removes
      some aspects that makes games great. So, I have added a game mode that I call gauntlet which is a series of preset
      challenges that unlocks as you complete them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each challenge is possible to win but also possible to lose. The gauntlet starts with a few units with only
      a few abilites each so that you can easily explore the units/monsters and their abilities without feeling overwhelmed.
      I plan to add different gauntlets with different AI levels and different monster compositions. But for now there
      are nine challenges to complete with one team of monsters from the Order of Idun.
