      I added something fantastic today. Rules!
    </p>
    <p>
      There is finally a central place to look up rules about the game. Even for myself, this
      is a boon because I don't have to be in doubt about a rule in the future. I have tried to
      be as clear as possible so that regarding skill level you can understand. It lacks a top level
      index but that will be added shortly.
