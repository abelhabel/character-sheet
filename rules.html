    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Fangalia is a tactical turn based game where two teams start on either side
      of a battle field and fight against each other until only one team is left.
    </p>
    <p>
      A team is a composition of different monsters, which you pick before a battle starts. Each
      monster has stats and a set of abilities. These stats and abilities together make each monster unique.
      It is, then, a matter of picking monsters so that they together as a team
      enables a game tactic that suits you and that you think will bring victory to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Battle is done through four separate actions: moving, defending, waiting and/or using abilities.
      These actions are all actions that can be done in a monster's turn and are not exclusive to each other.
      It is possible, for example, to first move then use an ability.
    </p>
    <p>
      These are only some high level concepts about the game and its rules but not all game concepts
      and terms have been introduced here, so please continue reading to learn more about specific concepts
    </p>

  <section id='basics'>
    <h2>Basics</h2>
    <section id='turn'>
      <h3>Turn</h3>
      <p>
        During combat, each monster in either team gets to act when it is their turn to act. When a monster gets to
        act is dependent on the monster's Initiative stat. The higher a monster's Initiative the earlier it gets to
        act. More on that in the Initiative section.
      </p>
      <p>
        When all monsters have used their turn a new Round starts.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id='round'>
      <h3>Round</h3>
      <p>
        A round consists of many turns. Specifically, at the start of each round each monster gets a number of turns
        in that round based on their Inititive stat. It is possible for one monster to get more than one turn in a round.
      </p>
      <p>
        A round is a measure of how long a battle has been going on but has not other significant impacts on the game.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id='moving'>
      <h3>Moving</h3>
      <p>
        On a monster's turn if it has a Movement stat above zero, the monster can move. The monster can move
        a number of tiles equal to its Movement stat. A move cannot be diagonal, meaning that if you want to move
        to an adjacent diagonal tile it will cost two movement.
      </p>
      <p>
        On any move you are using the monster's movement as a resource, so moving one tile has used one movement that turn.
        This resource is replenished to full at the start of a monster's turn.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moving does not end your turn. You can also make many small movements just as you can make one long movement in a turn,
        as long as you have not used up all your movement in that turn.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id='use-ability'>
      <h3>Use Ability</h3>
      <p>
        A monster can use as many abilities as their APT (Actions Per Turn) stat allows. Meaning that if a monster has an APT stat
        of 2, it can use two abilities (or one ability twice) in one turn.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once a monster has used abilities equal to its APT stat, the monster's turn end.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id='defend'>
      <h3>Defend</h3>
      <p>
        At any point during a monster's turn, it can defend. Defending immediately ends the turn and adds a
        circumstantial bonus to the monster's Defense stat. If the monster has moved that turn, the bonus will be less.
        Defending always gives a Defense bonus of at least 2. This bonus stacks with other effects.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id='wait'>
      <h3>Wait</h3>
      <p>
        Waiting delays a monster's turn to later in the same round. This can be tactically useful if a monster
        has no targets within range, allowing for enemies to move within range or allies to make the monster's turn
        more favorable when acting later. A monster can only wait once per round. If a monster has performed any other action
        in that turn it cannot wait.
      </p>

  <section id='terminology'>
    <h2>Terminology</h2>
    <section id='full-health'>
      <h3>Full Health</h3>
      <p>
        A monster is considered to be on full health when it has not taken any damage. A monster that first takes damage,
        but is then healed to full life, is considered to be on full health.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id='wounded'>
      <h3>Wounded</h3>
      <p>
        A monster is considered to be wounded when it has less than 50% of max health.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id='near-death'>
      <h3>Near Death</h3>
      <p>
        A monster is considered to be near death when it has less than 90% of max health.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id='adjacent'>
      <h3>Adjacent</h3>
      <p>
        Adjacent is a distance of 1. Diagonal tiles counts as 1. An enemy/ally is considered adjacent
        if it is at most 1 tile away.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id='near-by'>
      <h3>Near By</h3>
      <p>
        Near by is a distance of 3. Diagonal tiles counts as 1. An enemy/ally is considered near by
        if it is at most 3 tiles away.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id='far-away'>
      <h3>Far Away</h3>
      <p>
        Far away is a distance of 6 or more. Diagonal tiles counts as 1. An enemy/ally is considered far away
        if it is at least 6 tile away.
      </p>

  <section id='battle'>
    <h2>Battle</h2>
    <section id='flanking'>
      <h3>Flanking</h3>
      <p>
        A monster is considered flanked when two or more enemies are adjacent to it. For each adjacent enemy
        above one increases the damage taken by 20% when hit by attacks. It does not provide a damage bonus for spells.
      </p>
      <p>
        Example 1:<br>
        A monster that is hit by an attack while 2 enemies are adjacent takes: (2 - 1) * 20% = 20%, extra damage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Example 2:<br>
        A monster that is hit by an attack while 5 enemies are adjacent takes: (5 - 1) * 20% = 80%, extra damage.

  <section id='abilities'>
    <h2>Abilities</h2>
    <p>
      Monsters use abilities in order to deal damage or provide bonuses and penalties to a monster's stats.
    </p>
    <section id='type'>
      <h3>Type</h3>
      <p>
        There are three types of abilities: Active, Passive, and Trigger.
      </p>
      <section id='active'>
        <h4>Active</h4>
        <p>
          An active ability requires you to first select the ability and then activate the ability
          on the battle field. Activating an active ability is different depending on the ability's
          Target stat.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id='passive'>
        <h4>Passive</h4>
        <p>
          A passive ability is always in effect (unless it's condition is not met). A passive ability
          can either effect yourself or other monsters around the monster that has the passive ability.
          This is controlled by an ability's Shape, Radius, and Target stats.
        </p>
        <p>
          A passive ability that an area of effect is called an Aura.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id='trigger'>
        <h4>Trigger</h4>
        <p>
          A trigger ability cannot be selected to be used and is not active all the time. Instead
          a trigger activates when a certain event happens. The type of event is decided by the ability's
          Activation stat.
        </p>
        <p>
          These are the types of events that can trigger a trigger ability:<br>
          when attack hits, when self is hit, when adjacent ally is hit, when nearby ally is hit, when ally is hit, when adjacent enemy is hit, when nearyby enemy is hit, when enemy is hit, when adjacent enemy is slain, when enemy is slain by self
        </p>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section id='condition'>
      <h3>Condition</h3>
      <p>
        Some abilities require a condition to be met for the ability to be in effect.
      </p>
      <p>
        These conditions are: flanked, flanking, wounded, near death, full health
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id='shape'>
      <h3>Shape</h3>
      <p>
        The shape of an ability determines how it distributes over many tiles on the battle field.
      </p>
      <p>
        These are the shapes an ability can have: point, line, cone, circle, square.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id='radius'>
      <h3>Radius</h3>
      <p>
        The radius of an ability determines how far it's shape reaches. In the case when
        an ability's shape is set to Line the radius determines the length of the line.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id='target'>
      <h3>Target</h3>
      <p>
        The target consists of two pieces of information. The first, determines if you need to
        target a monster or if you need to target a tile, when you activate the ability on
        the battle field. The second piece of information determines what targets that will be hit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Targets that can be selected are one of these: actor, ground, or self.
      </p>
      <p>
        Targets that can be hit by the ability are one of these: allies, enemies, self, or all.
      </p>
      <p>
        The formatting of the target stat will look like this ground/enemies, or actor/allies. Or more generally put:
        [what to select]/[who the ability will hit]
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id='range'>
      <h3>Range</h3>
      <p>
        The range of an ability decides how many tiles away from the monster that is using the
        ability you can target. A range of 5 will let you target 5 tiles away in a square fashion, ie tiles
        diagonal to the monster counts as one tile away.
      </p>
      <p>
        An ability's shape has its origin where you target on the battle field. This means that if an
        ability has a range of 5, a shape of circle, and radius 3, the ability's area of effect will originate
        up to 5 tiles away in a circle with radius 3.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id='duration'>
      <h3>Duration</h3>
      <p>
        When an ability has a duration longer than 1, it will create en Effect. The Effect will then last
        for Turns equal to the duration. If the ability deals damage (Spell or Attack), then the damage will also be dealt
        at all subsequent rounds. If the ability affects a monster's stat, the effect will remain until the duration ends, ie
        the effect will not be reapplied on subsequent turns as is the case when the ability deals damage.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id='resource-cost'>
      <h3>Resource Cost</h3>
      <p>
        Some abilities has a resource cost. It is either Mana or Health. If an ability cost 4 Mana but the monster
        only has 3 Mana available, then the ability cannot be used. The same logic applies if the resource is health.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id='element'>
      <h3>Element</h3>
      <p>
        There are seven types of elements: force, fire, water, air, earth, vitality, rot
      </p>

        </p>
      </section>
      <section id='vitality'>

        <p>
          The vitality element represent life, divinity, hope, rejuvenation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vitality damage always heals monsters rather than damaging them, except for the Undead.
        </p>
      </section>

        </p>
      </section>

    </section>

    <section id='power'>
      <h3>Power</h3>
      <p>
        The power of an ability is what determines how much damage it does in the case of Attacks and Spells, or
        how much the bonus is in case of Blessings, or how much the penalty is in the case of Curses.
      </p>
      <p>
        The power consists of a minimum and maximum and a value between these two is then randomly chosen when the ability
        is used. This value is then also multiplied by the abilities multiplier. All these values are listed on all abilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        The monster's Damage stat is always added to the minimum and maximum power of an ability when the ability is
        an Attack or a Spell.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id='stacks'>
      <h3>Stacks</h3>
      <p>
        Stacking occurs when more than one of the same effect is applied at one time.
        However, there are specific rules for when effects stack and when they don't.
      </p>
      <p>
        Effects stack during the following conditions:
        <ul>
          <li>
            If the effect is a Spell or an Attack AND they have different sources.
            Example: Fire Ball and Dragon Fire, Flaming Arrow and Blizzard
          </li>
          <li>
            If the effects are from the same source AND
            the source is able to stack with itself. Example: Weakening Bite, Decaying Shot
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Effects do not stack during the following conditions:
        <ul>
          <li>
            If the effect is a Blessing or a Curse AND they are from different sources.
            Example: Aura of Corrotion and Corrode, Shield Wall and Armoured
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id='source'>
      <h3>Source</h3>
      <p>
        There are four different sources an ability can have: Attack, Spell, Blessing, Curse
      </p>
      <p>
        Attacks usually deal damage which is determined by a Damage Roll.
      </p>
      <p>
        Spells usually deal damage but can also have some special effect, such as teleport.
        Spell damage is determined by a Spell Roll.
      </p>
      <p>
        Blessings always gives a bonus to a monster's stat.
      </p>
      <p>
        Curses always gives a penalty to a monster's stat.
      </p>

  <section id='monsters'>
    <h2>Monsters</h2>
    <p>
      A monster is the central game mechanic, much like a chess piece is central to chess.
      Likewise, just as there are different chess pieces there are different monsters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each monster is unique in the sense that the combination of its stats and its abilities make them unique.
      Some monsters can stack.
    </p>

    <section id='family'>
      <h3>Family</h3>
      <p>
        A monster belongs to a family. You can think of this as a faction, group etc. A family of monsters represents
        a theme of both flavor and tactics. Outlaws focus on attacks but Demons focus more on spells, for example.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id='cost'>
      <h3>Cost</h3>
      <p>
        When selecting a team to do battle with, you have a maximum amount of cash to spend. Each monster has
        a cost which is then subtracted from your available cash if you add it to your team. The cost
        represent one unit of that monster.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id='max-stacks'>
      <h3>Max Stacks</h3>
      <p>
        Some monsters can stack together to form one battle unit made of multiple of the same monster. The
        max stacks says what the maximum any given monster can stack up to.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Bronze Dragon has a max stack of 1, so you can never have more than one Bronze Dragon in a battle unit.
        The Imp, can however stack up to 20 times, meaning that one battle unit can consist of up to 20 Imps.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id='health'>
      <h3>Health</h3>
      <p>
        The health of a monster determines how much damage can receive before it dies. A monster is dead if it has
        zero or lower health.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id='mana'>
      <h3>Mana</h3>
      <p>
        Mana is the main resource a monster use for using abilities. If a monster does not have any mana it cannot
        use abilities that have a mana cost of 1 or more.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id='attack'>
      <h3>Attack</h3>
      <p>
        When a monster uses an ability with source: attack, the monster uses its attack stat to determine how much damage
        is done to the target.
      </p>
      <p>
        An attacker's attack stat is always relative to a defenders defense stat when determining how much damage
        is inflicted on the defender. The higher the attack stat the higher the damage. The damage is calculated by the attack roll.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id='defense'>
      <h3>Defense</h3>
      <p>
        When a monster is being attacked by an ability with source: attack, the monster uses its defense stat to determine how much damage
        is done to it.
      </p>
      <p>
        A defenders defense stat is always relative to an attackers attack stat when determining how much damage
        is inflicted on the defender. The higher the attack stat the higher the damage. The damage is calculated by the attack roll.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id='spell-power'>
      <h3>Spell Power</h3>
      <p>
        When a monster uses an ability with source: spell, the monster uses its spell power stat to determine how much damage
        is done to the target. The damage is calculated by the spell roll.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id='spell-resistance'>
      <h3>Spell Resistance</h3>
      <p>
        When a monster is hit by an ability with source: spell, the monster uses its spell resistance stat to determine
        if it resists the spell it will resist the spell completely, meaning that the ability will have zero effect.
      </p>
      <p>
        A spell resistance stat of 100 means that the monster is immune to all spells, even beneficial spells.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id='damage'>
      <h3>Damage</h3>
      <p>
        The damage stat gives bonus to the minimum and maximum damage of attack and spell abilities.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id='apt'>
      <h3>APT (Actions Per Turn)</h3>
      <p>
        The APT says how many abilities that a monster can use per turn.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if a monster has more than one turn in a round, it still gets to use an amount of abilities
        on that turn equal to its APT stat.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id='tpt'>
      <h3>TPT (Triggers Per Turn)</h3>
      <p>
        The APT says how many abilities that can be triggered per turn.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if a monster has more than one turn in a round, it still gets to use an amount of triggered abilities
        on that turn equal to its TPT stat.
      </p>
      <p>
        A triggered ability is counted per target hit, ie if a monster casts a Fire Ball that hits 4 targets but the monster
        only has a TPT stat of 3, it can only trigger 3 triggered abilities. The abilities themselves, however, can hit
        as many targets as the ability allows.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id='movement'>
      <h3>Movement</h3>
      <p>
        The movement stat determines how many tiles a monster can move in a turn.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id='initiative'>
      <h3>Initiative</h3>
      <p>
        A monster's initiative determines how early a monster gets its turn in a round. When a monster's
        initiative is greater than 20, the monster will get more than one turn per round in certain rounds.
      </p>
      <p>
        Initiative also determines how manu turns a monster gets over 20 rounds. If a monster has an initiaitve of 31
        it will get 31 turns over 20 rounds, or initiative of 24 gives 24 turns over 20 rounds. However, a monster always
        gets at least 1 turn per rounds, so a monster that has an initiative of 4 still gets 1 turn per round,
        or 20 turns over 20 rounds.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is also possible to calculate when the monster will get those extra turns if the initiative is
        greater than 20, keeping track of a turn counter with these rules :</br>
        1. For turn, add (initiative - 20) to the turn counter.<br>
        2. When the turn counter is greater than 10, gain an extra turn.<br>
        3. When an extra turn is gained, subtract 20 from the turn counter.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        Example:<br>
        Monster initiative is 25.<br>
        Round 1, Turn 1: turn counter = 0.<br>
        - Add (25 - 20) to turn counter, turn counter = 0 + 5 = 5.<br>
        turn counter is less than 10. No extra turn this round.<br>
        <br>
        Round 2, Turn 1: turn counter = 5.<br>
        - Add (25 - 20) to turn counter, turn counter = 5 + 5 = 10.<br>
        turn counter is less than 10. No extra turn this round.<br>
        <br>
        Round 3, Turn 1: turn counter = 10.<br>
        - Add (25 - 20) to turn counter, turn counter = 10 + 5 = 15.<br>
        turn counter is more than 10. Gain extra turn!<br>
        - Subtract 20 from the turn counter, turn counter = 15 - 20 = -5.
      </p>
      <p>
        As can be seen, the monster will gain an extra turn on round 3. If you continue the same logic
        into future rounds, you can see that the monster will get extra turns on rounds 7, 11, 15, 19 etc.
